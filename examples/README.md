# vcfparser Examples

This directory contains working examples that demonstrate all the usage patterns from the main README.

## 📁 Files

- **`basic_usage.py`** - Comprehensive script demonstrating all 6 usage examples from the README
- **`example_output.vcf`** - Sample VCF file generated by the writing example

## 🚀 Running Examples

From the vcfparser root directory:

```bash
# Run all examples
python examples/basic_usage.py

# This will demonstrate:
# 📖 Basic VCF Parsing
# 🧬 Advanced Genotype Analysis  
# 📊 Metadata Export & Visualization
# ✍️ Writing VCF Files
# 📈 Working with Sample Data
# 🔍 Type-Safe Development
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- The `example.vcf` file must exist in the vcfparser root directory
- vcfparser must be installed or available in the Python path

## 📤 Generated Output

Running the examples will create:

- `example_output.json` - Metadata exported as JSON
- `example_output.table` - Metadata as table format  
- `example_output.dict` - Metadata as Python dictionary format
- `examples/example_output.vcf` - Sample VCF file created by writer

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to parse VCF metadata and access sample information
- Advanced genotype analysis techniques (HOMREF, HETVAR, HOMVAR detection)
- SNP vs INDEL variant type identification
- Phase information analysis (phased vs unphased genotypes)
- Metadata export in multiple formats
- VCF file creation with proper headers and records
- Sample-level data processing and filtering
- Type-safe development patterns with full type hints

## 📚 Next Steps

After running these examples, explore:

- Processing larger VCF files with memory-efficient iteration
- Integration with genomics analysis pipelines
- Custom genotype filtering and analysis workflows
- Performance optimization for large-scale data
